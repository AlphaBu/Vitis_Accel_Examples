Error Handling (C)
===================
This example discusses the different reasons for errors in OpenCL C++ and how to handle them at runtime. Host program uses various APIs like `clGetPlatformIDs`,`clGetPlatformInfo`  which may generate errors on unsuccessful execution. 
Common error codes  and possible reasons can be seen in the launch log of the sw-emulation for this example.

Errors codes, explanations and APIs which generate these errors are documented at
[Errors](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/errors.html).
