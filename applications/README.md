 __Examples Table__ 

Example        | Description           | Key Concepts / Keywords 
---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------
[kmeans/][]|This is OpenCL Based K-Means clustering Implementation for Xilinx FPGA Devices. K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. K-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.|
[median_filter/][]|This is an optimized implementation of a median filter being used to remove noise in images targeting execution on an SDAccel supported FPGA acceleration card.|
[watermarking/][]|This is an optimized implementation of a watermarking application to add watermarking to images targeting execution on an SDAccel supported FPGA acceleration card.|
