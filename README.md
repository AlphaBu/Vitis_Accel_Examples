Vitis Accel Examples' Repository
================================

Welcome to the Vitis Accel Examples' repository. This repository contains examples to showcase various features of the Vitis tools and platforms. It is expected that users has gone through the tutorials and has developed a basic understanding of the tools and the programming model. The examples illustrate specific scenarios related to host code and kernel programming  through a small working example. The intention is for users to be able to use these working examples as a reference while developing their own accelerator application based on Xilinx platforms.
