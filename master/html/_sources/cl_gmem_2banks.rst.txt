Global Memory Two Banks 
========================

This example of 2ddr to demonstrate on how to use 2ddr XSA. How to
create buffers in each DDR.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Multiple Banks

**KEYWORDS:** max_memory_ports, misc:map_connect

This example demonstrates how buffers can be created in two different
DDR(Global memory) banks.

By default, all the memory interfaces from all the kernels are connected
to a single global memory bank. As a result, only one memory interface
at a time can transfer data to and from the memory bank, limiting the
performance of the kernel. If the FPGA contains only one ``DDR`` (or
global) memory bank, this is the only option. However, some FPGA devices
contain multiple DDR memory banks. You can customize the connections
among the kernel memory interfaces and the DDR memory bank of such a
device by altering the default connection.

Banks need to be specified using ``--sp`` tags in the kernel linking
stage along with the ``port name`` and ``kernel name``.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   data/golden.bmp
   data/input.bmp
   src/apply_watermark.cl
   src/host.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./host <apply_watermark XCLBIN> ./data/input.bmp ./data/golden.bmp
